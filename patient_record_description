Patient Record Analysis - Jupyter Notebook Project
📋 Project Overview
This Jupyter Notebook project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hospital patient record data. The analysis focuses on understanding patient demographics, medical conditions, treatment procedures, costs, and outcomes to derive meaningful insights from healthcare data.

🎯 Objectives
Load and explore hospital patient data

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualize key patterns and relationships in patient records

Identify trends in patient satisfaction, costs, and treatment outcomes

📊 Dataset Information
The dataset contains 984 patient records with the following columns:

Original Columns:
Patient_ID: Unique identifier for each patient

Age: Patient age (range: 25-78 years)

Gender: Patient gender (Male/Female)

Condition: Medical condition/diagnosis

Procedure: Treatment/procedure performed

Cost: Treatment cost (range: 100-25,000)

Length_of_Stay: Days hospitalized (range: 1-76)

Readmission: Whether patient was readmitted (Yes/No)

Outcome: Treatment outcome (Recovered/Stable)

Satisfaction: Patient satisfaction score (1-5 scale)

Renamed Columns:
Disease: Originally "Condition"

Treatment: Originally "Procedure"

Readmitt: Originally "Readmission"

🔧 Technical Stack
Python 3.x

Libraries Used:

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

numpy: Numerical computations

seaborn: Statistical data visualization

matplotlib: Plotting and visualization

📈 Key Analysis Performed
1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
Loaded dataset from CSV file

Displayed first and last 5 records

Checked dataset shape (984 rows × 10 columns)

Examined data types and structure

2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Renamed columns for better readability:

Condition → Disease

Procedure → Treatment

Readmission → Readmitt

Handled missing values in Gender column by randomly assigning 'Male'/'Female'

Checked for duplicate records

3. Statistical Analysis
Generated descriptive statistics (mean, std, min, max, percentiles) for:

Age (Mean: 53.75 years)

Cost (Mean: $8,367, Range: $100-$25,000)

Length of Stay (Mean: 37.66 days)

Satisfaction (Mean: 3.6/5)

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Value Counts Analysis:

Readmission patterns by age

Satisfaction score distribution

Gender distribution

Data Quality Checks:

Verified no duplicate Gender entries

Checked data types consistency

5. Visualization
Created boxplots for numerical variables to identify:

Age Distribution: Relatively normal distribution with median around 55

Cost Distribution: Right-skewed with significant outliers (high-cost procedures)

Length of Stay: Wide distribution with several outliers (long hospital stays)

Satisfaction Scores: Concentrated around 3-4, with few extreme values

🎨 Key Visualizations
Age Boxplot: Shows age distribution with median around 55 years

Cost Boxplot: Highlights expensive medical procedures as outliers

Length of Stay Boxplot: Identifies unusually long hospital stays

Satisfaction Boxplot: Reveals patient satisfaction patterns

📊 Key Findings
Patient Demographics: Average age is 53.75 years, with patients ranging from 25-78 years

Treatment Costs: Significant variation in costs ($100 to $25,000), indicating diverse medical procedures

Hospital Stay: Average stay is 37.66 days, with some extreme cases up to 76 days

Patient Satisfaction: Generally positive (average 3.6/5), with most scores between 3-4

Readmission Patterns: Certain age groups show higher readmission rates
